# Introduction

#### From Bangladesh with love
It's a hot Tuesday afternoon when Chandni Akhand receives a call. Chandni works at a major bank in Bangladesh and everything looked fine until the phone rang. A representative from DBBT Bank, out of Philippines, is inquiring about a $2.3 million dollar wire transaction. Apparently the beneficiary name doesn't seem to match. Worse than that, introducing the transaction id in the core banking system shows not record of such transaction ever taking place. A hot flash goes through Chandni's face as she realizes something is seriously wrong. Things only get worse as at the end of the week the reconciliation system shows that over $800M has been transferred without any single record existing.


#### Japan's lovely country side
Hayato Suzuki was felling nervous. He walked down Shinsaibashi-suji, one of Osaka's main shopping areas, with a batch of credit cards in his pocket. Needless to say, none was legit. Trying not to look too conspicuous, he withdraws 100,000 yen from the corner ATM; his 12th withdraw of the day. Over the next couple of hours Hayato and his friends successful steal over 1.4 billion yen ($12.7M) in one of the largest coordinated on-foot heists in history. Over 14,000 withdraws take place across 16 prefectures using credit cards. The source: a major data leak at a South African bank.

#### Out on the street again
The web site was being bombarded again. Unfortunately, it wasn't a denial of service attack. It was much worse than that. Hundreds of bots were trying to buy perfume from the store using thousands of different IPs. While they weren't overloading the side, it was virtually impossible to distinguish legitimate customers from these automated buying machines. John Cash was in charge of cybersecurity and his job was at risk. Expensive perfume sells extremely well on the black market. How could criminals have become so sophisticated? When did his job really become so much at risk? Before the day ended his company would be out of $100,000 worth of stock. Not to mention all the chargebacks that were coming down the line due to the use of stolen credit cards on the web site.
