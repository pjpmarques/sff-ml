It's a hot Tuesday afternoon when Chandni Akhand receives a call. Chandni works at a major bank in Bangladesh and everything looked fine until the phone rang. A representative from DBBT Bank, out of Philippines, is inquiring about a $2.3 million dollar wire transaction. Apparently the beneficiary name doesn't seem to match. Worse than that, introducing the transaction id in the core banking system shows not record of such transaction ever taking place.
