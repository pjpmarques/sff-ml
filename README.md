# Street Fighting Fraud with Machine Learning

This book is about using Machine Learning to fight fraud. Machine Learning --*the ability to have computers automatically learn and detect patterns*-- is one of the most exciting advances in computer science of the last 10 years. Only now with the exponential increase in computational power, wide availability of data, and advances in distributed processing, it's truly possible to leverage machine learning to its true potential.

For the past years we have been at the front lines of preventing fraud. Our moto: "Make Commerce Safe." In this book we intend to share some of the stories but, more importantly, contribute to the fight against fraud. Machine Learning gives you super powers. Use them for good.
