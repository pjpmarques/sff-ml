# Introduction

### From Bangladesh with love
It's a hot Tuesday afternoon when Chandni Akhand receives a call. Chandni works at a major bank in Bangladesh and everything looked fine until the phone rang. A representative from DBBT Bank, out of Philippines, is inquiring about a $2.3 million dollar wire transaction. Apparently the beneficiary name doesn't seem to match. Worse than that, introducing the transaction id in the core banking system shows not record of such transaction ever taking place. A hot flash goes through Chandni's face as she realizes something is seriously wrong. Things only get worse as at the end of the week the reconciliation system shows that over $800M has been transferred without any single record existing.
